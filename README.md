## Project Overview

AutoSentinel-Improved is an advanced, modular, Python-based cybersecurity framework tailored for enterprise network defense, SOC automation, and AI-driven security research. It leverages state-of-the-art computer vision (Vision Transformer), multi-agent reinforcement learning, and large language models to autonomously detect, analyze, and report cybersecurity threats in real time.

## Features

- **Improved Vision Transformer:** Enhanced ViT architecture for robust visual threat detection (50.9% accuracy).
- **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning:** Collaborative agents for adaptive, autonomous defense strategies.
- **LLM Integration:** Contextual understanding, threat analysis, and automated reporting using large language models.
- **Fully Automated Pipeline:** End-to-end detection, analysis, and response.
- **Modular Python Codebase:** Easily extend or integrate new components.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Threat Detection

```bash
python main.py --config configs/main.yaml
```
**Expected Output:**
```
[INFO] System initialized...
[DETECT] Threat detected: DoS attack at 10.0.0.1
```

### Custom Configuration

Edit `configs/main.yaml` for your own network environment and run:

```bash
python main.py --config configs/custom.yaml
```
