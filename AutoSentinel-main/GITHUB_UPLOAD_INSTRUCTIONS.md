- âœ… Comprehensive documentation and testing

## Manual GitHub Upload Steps

### Step 1: Create New GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `AutoSentinel-Improved`
3. Description: `Advanced Cybersecurity System with Improved Vision Transformer (50.9% accuracy), Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, and LLM Integration for Autonomous Threat Detection`
4. Make it Public
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Upload Local Repository
After creating the repository, run these commands in PowerShell:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\abedr\Downloads\Autosentinel\AutoSentinel-main"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AutoSentinel-Improved.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### Step 3: Verify Upload
After uploading, your repository should contain:

#### Core Improved Files:
- `train_vit_efficient.py` - **BEST ViT training script (50.9% accuracy)**
- `train_vit_improved.py` - First improvement (31.7% accuracy)
- `train_vit_advanced.py` - Advanced architecture version
- `train_vit_optimized.py` - Balanced approach
- `train_vit_fast.py` - Speed-optimized version
- `README_IMPROVED.md` - **Comprehensive documentation**

#### Fixed Original Files:
- `train_vit.py` - Fixed syntax errors in original
- All other original AutoSentinel files

#### Trained Models:
- `models/vit/efficient_vit_checkpoint.json` - Trained efficient ViT model
- `models/marl/` - Multi-agent reinforcement learning models
- `data/processed/` - Preprocessed cybersecurity datasets
